learning github

I'm 33. I'm bad at writing code. I'm okay with things like linux system administration and small, medium, large, and enterprise networking. (I'm better at playing the drums, and/or rocket league, but I'm servicable at just about anything I apply myself too. I mean, other people can learn it, why can't I?)
I'm thinking this is a long enough edit for the sake of the tutorial.
